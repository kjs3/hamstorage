### Small, simple module to make using localStorage a little easier and safer.

* Safe - falls back to object store if localStorage is not available
* Serializes/deserializes values by default
* As tiny as I can figure out how to make it **(~ 0.5K gzipped)**.

Basically, this is what I keep creating in every frontend project to take the edges off localStorage.
